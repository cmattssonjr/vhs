.SH EXAMPLES
At all times, without any required arguments, the output file  will be as configured in the config file (default: mkv).
.br
You can change to any container you want, for a one-time-use, by passing
.B "-e webm"
so it would encode 'this' video to webm.
.br
If you change the container/extension to an audio format, it will output an audiofile only.
.br
At each call, you'll be presented an invoked call of
.B vhs -i inputfile
to show the file its streams.

.IP "vhs filename"
Will encode 'filename' according to your configured favorite settings

.IP "vhs -e mp3 -I 1 -z 3:41.15-1:16:21.007 InputVideo.webm"
This will extract the audio stream #1 from InputVideo.webm starting at 3 minutes 41 seconds and 150 milisecs and stops at 1 hour 16 minutes 21 seconds and 7 miliseconds, saving it as mp3.

.IP "vhs -Dq qvga"
Use this to prepare a DVD for your smartphone.

.IP "vhs -Dtl jpn"
This will encode the DVD/BR/LD in your drive, including subtitles and add japanese to the list of langauges, both, subtitle and audio.
.br
Note that you can configure vhs to use only one, or two langauges by default for all your output files.

.IP "vhs -SQ yt-1080"
Will record your screen and save the file at youtube bitrates as 1920x1080 video.
.br
Note that if your desktop/screen resolution is smaller, you have no benefit but a larger file.

.IP "vhs -Wq yt-720"
This will require your computer to have a webcam connected or internaly enabled, and will save the output video at youtube presets for HD Ready videos, preserving the aspect ratio of your webcam (eg: 640:-1)
.br
If you just want to do your personal video log, it could be reduced to:
.B "vhs -W"



.SH FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
.B 1. "When i want to save a video with subtitles it keeps failing."
.br
Try to just copy the subtitle codec by passing
.B -c tcopy

.br
.B 2. "I have many files to encode, and it keeps asking me to select which language to choose for each file."
.br
Assuming the desired language is always on the same stream id, you could use:
.B vhs -I 1 inputvideo
.br
If you want to include multiple audio streams, and want to avoid beeing asked for each video, you could use either one of:
.br
*
.B vhs -I "'3 4'" inputvideo
.br
*
.B vhs -I 3 -I 4 inputvideo
.br

.B 3. "After saving subtitles with a video, the font looks diffrent."
.br
Have you made sure the attachments were used, using the
