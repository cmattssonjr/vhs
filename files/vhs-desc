Video Helper Script / VHS
Be adviced that this script is ment to simply encode a video to some default container/extension and using its default codecs.
It is also ment to require at least a one time setup - review of default values, for the aim of a prefered default output format.


If no arguments but a video file is submited, it will be using the original video bitrates to encode to the default container.
If the source container is the same as the default container, it will be named like VIDEO.0.CONTAINER, where 0 be increased if it already exists.


Eventhough i first wanted to ease the achievment of FOSS encoded videos on my NAS, my TV doesnt support them.
Therefor it is using Matroska as default, understand that you must have the required codecs installed from http://repo.rpmfusion.org or similar.


Also since my prefered 'quality' is HD Ready (1280*720), the default bitrates are set accordingly.
If you like this default bitrates that may be used using '-B', you can change them per call using: '-b v2048' for video or '-b a512' for audio bitrates.
In the same way you could change the used codecs by passing: '-c vbmp -c awavpack'


If you want to encode a video to another than your defaul container, you may do so by passing: '-e mp4'
Please understand that as of now only 4 containers/extensions are supported::	webm ogg mkv mp4
Allthough there are more container files in the folder, the use of the unused is still in planing.

(note that for the output to be of good quality, the source file must be good quality too!)
